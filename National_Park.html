    <h2>The National Park Service (NPS)</h2>

    <p1> The National Park Service (NPS) is an agency of the United States federal government that manages all U.S. national parks, and historical properties. <br>
      It was created on August 25, 1916, by Congress through the National Park Service Organic Act and is an agency of the United States Department of the Interior. <br>
      The NPS is charged with the role of preserving the ecological and historical integrity of its charges while also making them available for public use and enjoyment.
    </p1>
<br><br>
    <p2>Since 1916, the National Park Service has managed each of the United States' national parks, which have grown in number over the years to 59. <br>
        In 1872 Yellowstone became the first national park in the United States. Since there was no state government to manage it, the federal government assumed direct control. <br>
        At first, each national park was managed independently, with varying degrees of success. Due to irregularities in managing the parks, Stephen Mather petitioned the federal government to make improvements.
        Mather lobbyed for creating a new agency, the National Park Service, to manage all national parks and some national monuments. He was successful with the ratification of the National Park Service Organic Act in 1916. </p2>
